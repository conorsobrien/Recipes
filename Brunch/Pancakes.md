Regular (but fluffy) Pancakes
-----------------------------------------
Makes enough for 3-4 servings.
<ul>
  <li>1.5 (386g) cups milk </li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>2 cups (300g) all-purpose flour </li>
  <li>1/4 cup (62g) granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon (4g) salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon (1g) baking soda</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon (12g) baking powder </li>
  <li>2 (21g) tablespoon melted butter</li>
</ul>

Mix wet ingredients (Milk, eggs & melted butter) separately. 
Mix dry ingredients.
Combine dry and wet ingredients.

Cook on medium-hot thick pan. Waiting for bubbles to appear on top a bad idea as they can burn. Check undersides to know when to flip.
