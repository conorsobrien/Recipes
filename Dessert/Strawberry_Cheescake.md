# Strawberry Cheesecake

## Ingredients
* Aldi creame cheese, 200g tub x 2
* Aldi mascarpone cheese, xxxg tub x 1
* Gelatin sachets x 2
* Cream 400ml
* Sugar (granulated) 120g
* Lemon juice
* Vanilla extract
* Big box of strawberries
* Butter
* Digestive biscuits

## Steps
1. Blend room temperature cream cheese, mascarpone and granulated sugar. 
2. Simmar chopped strawberries with 2 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Blend and let cool slightly
3. Whip cream.
4. Add gelatin to warm strawberry blend.
5. Mix gelatin/strawberry with cream cheese mix in iterations.
6. Fold in cream gently to maintain air.

## Notes so far
* Creame cheese flavour can be a bit strong. Do what you can to mitigate. More fruit in the mix? Less cream cheese proportionally?
* Biscuit base needs to be nice and thick. Previous iteration was maybe 3-4mm deep. Aim for ~6mm next time. 
* Consider greasing the springform tin edges next time to ensure smooth extraction.
