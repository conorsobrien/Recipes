Goes well with wings, pizza etc. Could also be a salad dressing (though not the healthiest).

 ## Ingredients
1. Sour Cream
2. Mayonnaise
3. Crushed Garlic (the pre-crushed in oil seems to work best).
4. Chives 
5. Parsley

 ## Instructions
Combine in proportion:
* 3 Tbsp mayonnaise
* 2 Tbsp sour cream
* 1 tsp crushed garlic
* 1 Tbsp chives
* 1 tsp parsley

Add a bit of water or buttermilk (not essential) to loosen to desired consistency. Salt and black pepper to taste.
